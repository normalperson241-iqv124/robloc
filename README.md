i might no longer create any more roblox scripts since i have switched to linux (erased disk, no turning back) and have no way to test scripts on roblox due to them banning wine (and vinegar, grapejuice etc etc mostly because they run off of wine)

-- HITBOX EXPANDER CHANGELOG --

v1.0 -
made the script lmao

v1.2 -
made scripts toggle, also removed skidded esp and made my own with a tutorial because im a dumbass
